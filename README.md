# patternReader
A python program used to analyse JMH microbenchmark outputs using Time Series analysis methods.

Used for my final project in COSC 5P07 at Brock University.

Uses primarily Stumpy and Ruptures packages, as well as input data from https://github.com/SEALABQualityGroup/icpe-data-challenge-jmh stored in the directory \timeseries from the source.
